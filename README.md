# BioSNICAR_GO_PY

This repository is specifically for the parameterization of BioSNICAR_GO, ideally creating a single linear equation that predicts the full model output to sufficient accuracy and can then be used as a lightweight alternative to the full RTM for surface mass balance modelling.

For users interested in the full model, the repository is here: www.github.com/jmcook1186/BioSNICAR_GO_PY.
